"A digital heartbeat wrapped in candy-coated code."

Watermark: @ngaithemes

🧠 CORE PHILOSOPHY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This experience was engineered to bypass the traditional "static web" and enter the realm of Emotional UI. Every pixel, every bounce, and every 3D shadow is designed to make the user feel:

Playful & Rewarding: Every click produces a reaction.

Visually Instant: Hooks the user in under 3 seconds.

Emotionally Expressive: Replaces long text with high-quality GIFs and 3D micro-interactions.

Premium Chaos: A perfect blend of "Candy-like" aesthetics and high-end technical performance.

🚀 TECH STACK & ARCHITECTURE

Built with a "Performance-First" mindset to ensure mobile-smooth interactions.

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Custom Pastel Configuration)

Animations: Framer Motion (Spring-physics based)

3D Rendering: Three.js + React Three Fiber (R3F)

Interactivity: @react-three/drei (Presentation Controls)

Audio Engine: HTML5 Audio API with global state management.

🧭 EXPERIENCE FLOW (THE JOURNEY)
1️⃣ The Hook (Entry)

Visual: Cute animated panda GIF.

Interaction: Large "Show me 😳" CTA.

Audio: Instant music.mp3 fade-in on user engagement.

2️⃣ The Emotional Hit

Logic: Fade-in typography ("It’s Always You").

Chaos: Randomized floating GIF reactions appearing across the viewport.

3️⃣ Candy Chaos

Physics: Every 1 second, a candy GIF spawns and falls with rotation.

Interaction: Tapping a candy triggers a pop.mp3 and a "for my cutipie 🍬" micro-interaction.

4️⃣ The Masterpiece: 3D Dairy Milk (ULTRA-IMPORTANT)

The Model: A high-resolution .glb Dairy Milk chocolate bar.

Gesture: User swipes to "peel" the wrapper realistically.

Bite Logic: Multi-tap bite detection. The chocolate geometry visually updates with bite marks using state-driven scaling and crunch.mp3.

5️⃣ Love Meter (Heart Overload)

Behavior: A meter that fills automatically but accelerates with user taps.

Dynamic States: Progresses from "Okay okay" to "HEART OVERLOAD" to a final screen-shaking explosion.

6️⃣ Mini-Game: Catch My Heart

Logic: A high-speed reactivity test where the user must catch 10 hearts.

Feedback: Instant sparkles and haptic-style animations on every success.

7️⃣ Final Page

Outcome: A looping emotional GIF with a "Replay" option to restart the cycle.

Footer: Subtly branded with @ngaithemes.

🎨 VISUAL LANGUAGE

Typography:

Headings: Fredoka (Rounded, Playful)
